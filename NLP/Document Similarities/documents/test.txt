Kavanaugh Angrily Denies Assault Allegation After Ford Testimony

Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh angrily and "unequivocally" denied sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford, after she told senators at a dramatic hearing that she’s "one hundred percent" certain he is the one who attacked her when they were teenagers.

"I was not at the party described by Dr. Ford," Kavanaugh told the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday as he tried to save his nomination in the face of public claims of sexual misconduct by three women. "This confirmation process has become a national disgrace."

Kavanaugh’s testimony gave senators a stark choice. Earlier in the day, Ford said her accusation was "absolutely not" a case of mistaken identity. She said the 1982 incident -- including the "uproarious laughter" of Kavanaugh and his friend who she says witnessed the attack -- was "seared into my memory" even though she didn’t remember all the details.
